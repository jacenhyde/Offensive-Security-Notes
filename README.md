# Offensive-Security-Notes

Welcome to my list of notes taken for my own personal Offensive Security studies from my own personal experience of research, this is limited to no specific resource but a collection of all my different notebooks for studying. This is intended to be used in an educational and ethical manner, using any documentation for any other form of intent is greatly frowned upon.

## Directories

- This Repo will contain notes/cheatsheets for tools across different domains of hacking, the only things I will not include are binary exploitation notes, and real scripts for attacking a service beyond making a wordlist.

The directories listed will be:

/AD
/Cloud
/C2
/Host
/Web


All including various sub-directories including my notes for studies.
